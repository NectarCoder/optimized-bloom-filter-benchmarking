For our Bloom filter project, I suggest we use the Brown Corpus as our dataset. It’s a classic and balanced English dataset that’s not too small and not too huge — perfect for testing.

 Size: about 1 million words
 Structure: 500 text samples, each around 2,000 words
 Labels: grouped into 15 categories (like press, fiction, religion, government, etc.), which are often combined into 5 broad labels
 This makes it really good for both simple membership testing and optional experiments like category-based Bloom filters.

Preprocessing steps we’ll need:

Lowercase all words so “The” and “the” are treated the same.
Remove punctuation, keep only letters/numbers.
Optionally replace numbers with a <NUM> token.
Build a set of unique words for insertion into the Bloom filter.
Create test sets:
Positive set (words we inserted).
Negative set (words not in the filter, or we can even create random fake words "afdad" to test bloom filter accuracy
That way, we can check false positives, measure performance, and even try per-category filters if we want to explore classification.

if we want to scale up we can test our bloom filter design on some high dimension datasets too but thats for later for example:

Project Gutenberg
25K+ books (~20–30M words)

Europarl Corpus
~60M words (English subset.
